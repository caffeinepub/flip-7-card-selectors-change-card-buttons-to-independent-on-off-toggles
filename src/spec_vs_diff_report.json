The UI/layout changes (always-visible checkbox next to score input, right-justified alignment, and disable-rule preservation) are not verifiable from the truncated diff. Additional non-requested metadata/documentation files were modified.",

      "reason": "While phaseCompletions state is initialized (including default false for new rounds and loading from initialState), the truncated diff does not show the rendered checkbox/label being always visible, nor does it show the disable logic being preserved (e.g., disabled when not owner and/or while submitting).",

      "requirement": "Adjust layout so the score input and \"Phase complete\" checkbox+label are on the same line, with the control right-justified and responsive on narrow widths.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated before the relevant JSX layout; there is no visible evidence that the checkbox+label is positioned on the same horizontal line as the score input and right-justified, or that responsive wrapping was handled.",
