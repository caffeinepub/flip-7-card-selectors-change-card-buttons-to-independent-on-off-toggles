  "summary": "Diff updates Phase10ScoreEntry to initialize phase-complete state to false for new rounds and snapshots completion state at submit time, but evidence is insufficient/absent for the required visual checkbox behavior and for ensuring phase progression is applied only when completed=true across both saved and quick sessions. The code also retains an optional one-way (non-uncheckable) checkbox mode that can conflict with the requested free toggling behavior.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Phase 10 phase-complete checkbox visually behaves like a standard checkbox: the checkmark is visible only when checked and not visible when unchecked; no custom styling causes the check indicator to remain visible when unchecked.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet does not show the actual Checkbox rendering props/styling (truncated after computing isChecked). There is no evidence in the provided diff summary that the visual checkmark issue was addressed.",

      "requirement": "During Phase 10 score submission, only record/log phase completion if checked at submission time; for saved sessions backend submission must not increment/update progress where completed=false; for quick sessions local phase10Progress must not increment for completed=false.",
      "reason": "Frontend now snapshots `phaseCompletions` into `entryState` at submission time, but the diff provides no evidence that saved-session submission payload handling/backend update logic filters out completed=false, nor that quick-session local phase10Progress update logic ignores false completions. No backend files were modified in this diff summary.",

      "description": "Optional one-way (non-uncheckable) phase-complete checkbox behavior via `oneWayCheckbox` prop that prevents unchecking once checked.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest requires free toggling (check and uncheck) before submission; adding/retaining a mode that blocks unchecking is not requested and can directly violate REQ-1 depending on how it is used.",

      "reason": "Not requested by the BuildRequest (which explicitly calls out not changing Phase 10 sorting/standings logic and focuses only on checkbox submission behavior). This may be benign, but it is an unrequested behavioral change shown in the diff.",
