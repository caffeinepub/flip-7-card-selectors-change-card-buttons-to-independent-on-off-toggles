  "summary": "Flip7ScoreEntry.tsx was updated to track selected cards per player using a Map of Sets and to toggle individual card IDs on/off, with tally computed as the sum of currently selected card values. However, due to truncation of the main component render/submit logic, some visual/accessibility and post-submit reset/validation requirements cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary. Two non-requested project metadata/summary files were also modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Visually represent each card selector’s toggle state using a clear, standard on/off style (distinct ON vs OFF styling) and ensure the styling is accessible (not color-only; e.g., pressed state/check indicator).",
      "reason": "The diff shows new state management and imports (e.g., Switch, Check), but the JSX/rendered card grid and styling/ARIA behavior are not visible in the truncated file, so the required visual and accessible toggle representation cannot be confirmed.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "After Add Round submission, all per-player toggle states reset to OFF (along with existing manual score and x2 reset behavior), and Add Round enable/disable validation continues to work with the new toggle-based tally (valid if manual score valid OR at least one toggle ON/tally>0).",
      "reason": "The diff includes getFinalScore() and starts handleSubmit(), but the submission logic and any post-submit resets/validation gating are truncated, so it cannot be verified that toggle state resets after submission and that the Add Round enable/disable logic is correctly updated/preserved.",
