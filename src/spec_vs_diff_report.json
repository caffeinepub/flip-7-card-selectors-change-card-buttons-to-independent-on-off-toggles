  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented in scoring utilities by changing the game-end result shape to `winners: PlayerStanding[]` and returning all tied players for Nerts and Flip 7 when the win target is met. REQ-2 (ScoreSheetScreen game-over UI tie messaging) cannot be confirmed from the provided truncated diff snippet; there is no visible evidence of updated UI copy/logic handling multiple winners.",

      "requirement": "Update the game-over UI on the score sheet to correctly display ties for first place: if multiple winners are returned, show all tied player names and indicate they are tied for first place with the winning score.",
      "reason": "The provided `ScoreSheetScreen.tsx` diff is truncated and does not show any game-over UI rendering logic that formats/prints multiple winner names or a tie-for-first message. The snippet only shows `checkGameEnd(...)` being called.",
